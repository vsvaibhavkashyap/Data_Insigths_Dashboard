# WORLDWIDE VACATION DAYS

# INTRODUCTION

Taking a break from routine work is essential. Not only does it provide quality time with family and friends, but it also allows us to step away and reset, returning to our work refreshed and clear-headed. I was curious to analyse which countries have most and least paid leaves across the world.
